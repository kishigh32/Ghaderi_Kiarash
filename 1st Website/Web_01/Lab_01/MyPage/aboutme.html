The first tag you create on a website declares the doctype.
Everything in a web object is contained within the opening and closing tags. Everything outside the tags belongs to another object.
The head of a site includes information for the browser. The information in the head is not seen by the user of the site.
The body of the site includes all of the actual site content.
